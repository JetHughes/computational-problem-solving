# Desert Crossing

## Problem Description
You are planning to cross a desert 2413 km wide in a special desert vehicle.
- The vehicle can travel 12 km on 1 litre of fuel.
- It has a 60 litre tank and can carry at most four 20 litre cans.
- The only source of fuel and cans is at the base of the desert/ Fuel and cans at the base are not limited.

## Tasks

### 1. Using the vehicle without refuelling, how far into the desert can you *safely* go?

Assuming a full tank and four full cans, the vehicle could safely venture out half of its fuel capacity, leaving the last half to enable the vehicle to come back to safety.

Total fuel capacity: 60L tank + 4 x 20L cans = 140 litres.

140 / 2 = 70 litres per direction.

70 * 12km = 840 km from base.

Therefore, the desert vehicle could safely traverse 840km of desert from base with enough fuel to return.

### 2. Describe a procedure whereby you could cross the desert in the vehicle.


### 3. Describe a procedure whereby you could cross the desert and return in the vehicle.

### 4. Describe a procedure whereby you could cross the desert in the vehicle using the minimum amount of fuel.


### 5. Describe a procedure whereby you could cross the desert and return in the vehicle using the minimum amount of fuel.
